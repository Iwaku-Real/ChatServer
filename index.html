        <h3>The server IP/port is the same one you are on right now!</h3>
        <h1>Welcome to my chat server!</h1>
        <p>
            This is a project I've been wanting to do for quite a while now. I thought it would be fun to run a chat server
            and have people like you join. If you are seeing this right now, I'm glad you're here. I'm happy to even know
            the server works fine for you. ðŸ˜‰
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the chat server only runs on TCP and I'm still figuring out how to write a web version. You will have
            to use a <s>TCP client such as Telnet or PuTTY</s> <em>Python script that I wrote</em> to join. If you don't know what any of it is, don't worry â€“ I'll
            explain it below.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still working on all of this and not everything is done (including web support as above). So there isn't a
            lot of functionality. And you can't send emojis either. Don't try to send any non-ASCII characters through the
            server. Don't even try to DDoS it.
        </p>
        <p>This web page was written in HTML, and the server was entirely written in Python.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>...Are you bored yet?</p>
        <p>Okay, enough info, I'll now show you how to join.</p>

        <hr>

        <h1>How to join </h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Windows">Windows<s>/Mac/Linux</s></a></li>
            <li><!--a href="#Android/iOS"--><s>Android/iOS</s><!--/a--></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>NOTE: If your username isn't working it's because it's either already taken or it's whitespace.</h3>

        <p>
            Up until now I haven't realized Telnet was a terrible idea to use for a chat client. New messages would overlap
            with input which would result in you being unable to read what you're trying to type. So I've written a custom
            client using Tkinter and <em>if you have Python 3+ installed</em> (or you're not on Windows), you can <a href="client.py">get the script
            here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="client.exe">Download this</a> if you <em>DON'T</em> have Python.
